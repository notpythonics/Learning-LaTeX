% LaTeX also provides commands without arguments, which work like switches.

\documentclass{article}

\begin{document}
\sffamily\bfseries Get help on the Internet

\normalfont\ttfamily https://latex.org/normalfont is a support forum for \LaTeX.
\end{document}

% By using the \sffamily command, we switched to the sans-serif typeface. The  
% \bfseries command switched the text to bold. We used the \normalfont command 
% to return to the default LaTeX font, and then we used the \ttfamily command to 
% switch to a typewriter font. After the internet address, we used \normalfont again to 
% switch to the default font.

% Such switching commands don't produce any output themselves, but they will affect the 
% text that follows it, so they are declarations.
% remember: declarations are cmds that only change properties
