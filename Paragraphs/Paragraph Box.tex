% \parbox[alignment][height][inner alignment]{width}{text}

% alignment: That's the optional argument for vertical alignment. State t to align at 
% the baseline of the top line of the box; write b to align at the baseline of its bottom 
% line. The default behavior is to place the box such that its center is in line with the 
% center of the current text line.
