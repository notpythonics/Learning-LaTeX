why is there a space before a line of text?
Indenting refers to the practice of creating a space at the beginning of a line or paragraph, typically to indicate a new paragraph or to format text.
\noindent


why is there a blank page?
Traditionally and commnly, chapters start on odd-numbered pages (right-hand pages) in printed books.
To achive this, LaTeX inserts a blank even-numbered page (left-hand pages), so the next chapter can start on an odd-numbered page.


why are the margins different on the second page?
Because when two pages are bound togther they need a free space to glue togther without covering text.
Search on Goggle pic "inner and outer margins".
\usepackage[a4paper, innter=1.5cm, outer=3cm, top=2cm, bottom=3cm, bindingoffset=0.5cm]{geometry}

If your book will always be an e-book, you don't need inner and outer margins.
\usepackage[a4paper, left=2.5cm, right=2.5cm, top=2cm, bottom=3cm]{geometry}


Justification is how text is aligned
